This is currently a draft! Realistically, I know a lot of people prefer info sheets to separate pages when browsing for commissions; however so long as I keep *this* page up to date I'll know what I've set my prices as, and can refer back and update when necessary

### Commission Info

TODO: time art pieces to get a proper idea as to a good price.

Commission info should contain:
    - commission types
    - examples and prices for each type
    - terms & conditions
    - general info of what I will and won't draw
    - turnaround times
