Set in the same universe as the [Imperial Radch](../ancillary-justice) trilogy, this book follows Ingray, a young woman from the Hwean system. When a purchase goes wrong, she has to juggle with her politics and family to prevent disaster.

After the original trilogy, it was nice to see what the Radchaai look like from outside of their domain. It also contrasted nicely with Breq's perspective from the previous books - the conflict is a smaller scale, and though Hwae is seemingly unrelated to the goings-on of the Radchaai, I still found myself invested in Ingray's struggle by the end.
