The Murderbot Diaries is a series of novels and novellas following Murderbot, a sentient bot who has hacked its governor chip.  

I loved this series. Most of the novellas are relatively short, and easy reading. Despite that, each one manages a good amount of depth in terms of character, and Murderbot's point of view is distinctive and fun to read.
