**Ancillary Justice**

The first in a loose trilogy, Breq is the lone remaining body of a ship's AI following a disaster not specified - what we know is she's angry, and she's seeking someone.

I found Breq's perspective interesting; the use of a single pronoun in a society where gender isn't baked into the language was fresh to read, and executed fairly cleanly. I'm sure essays could (and probably have) be written on that alone, but what I found far more intriguing was the perspective of a hive-mind AI.

**Ancillary Sword** and **Ancillary Mercy** ★★★★☆

Both of these follow on from where we left off in *Ancillary Justice* - Breq's been dispatched to another system, tasked with a mission but following her own motives.  
These books were also both fun, and I enjoyed reading them, but they ultimately lacked the multi-person ship's perspective that made the first book so special.
