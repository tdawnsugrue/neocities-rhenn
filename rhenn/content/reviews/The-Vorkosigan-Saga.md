Overall, I enjoyed this series, with some major caveats.

Miles is a very fun character to follow, and these books hold up well. The early books are (mostly) very fun, and I found most of them no challenge to get through.

My main problem was with the latter half of the series. As with most of Bujold's books, there's a tendency for characters to get happily traditionally married by the end of the series. On its own, this isn't bad, but it grates a little when it happens for *every character*. *Even the gay ones*. Sigh.
