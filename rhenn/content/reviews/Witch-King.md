*Witch King* follows the story of the demon Kai, who awakens after being killed, and his journey to find out what happened.

I wanted to enjoy *Witch King* more than I did. I loved Kai as a protagonist, and Wells' writing was enjoyable, but it suffered from the split timeline.  

*Witch King* has two timelines - one set in the present, and one in the past. Both were very interesting, but I felt like not enough time was spent on either, leaving us with two half-stories. That said, I'm still hoping for a sequel.
