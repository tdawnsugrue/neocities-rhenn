The Eternal Sky trilogy follows the journey of Re Temur, as he seeks to reclaim his grandfather's throne. Along with Temur, the series follows a number of other character perspectives. 

As with the sequel series, Bear does a brilliant job of handling this; despite the large cast of characters most of them feel well fleshed out and interesting. These novels felt quite dense at times though - though I never *struggled* to get through them, they each took a long time to finish.
