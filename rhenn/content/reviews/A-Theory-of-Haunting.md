I'll admit, I'm biased towards Monette's writing. I read *Melusine* a lot back in highschool, and it was a keystone in forming my tastes.

I enjoyed the mystery of this book. Kyle Murchison Booth is always fun to read, and Monette is very good at what she does. I only wish it was a little longer, as the ending felt quite abrupt.
