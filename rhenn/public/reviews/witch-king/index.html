        <p><em>Witch King</em> follows the story of the demon Kai, who awakens after being killed, and his journey to find out what happened.</p>
<p>I wanted to enjoy <em>Witch King</em> more than I did. I loved Kai as a protagonist, and Wells&rsquo; writing was enjoyable, but it suffered from the split timeline.</p>
<p><em>Witch King</em> has two timelines - one set in the present, and one in the past. Both were very interesting, but I felt like not enough time was spent on either, leaving us with two half-stories. That said, I&rsquo;m still hoping for a sequel.</p>
