        <p><strong>Ancillary Justice</strong></p>
<p>The first in a loose trilogy, Breq is the lone remaining body of a ship&rsquo;s AI following a disaster not specified - what we know is she&rsquo;s angry, and she&rsquo;s seeking someone.</p>
<p>I found Breq&rsquo;s perspective interesting; the use of a single pronoun in a society where gender isn&rsquo;t baked into the language was fresh to read, and executed fairly cleanly. I&rsquo;m sure essays could (and probably have) be written on that alone, but what I found far more intriguing was the perspective of a hive-mind AI.</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary Sword</strong> and <strong>Ancillary Mercy</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
<p>Both of these follow on from where we left off in <em>Ancillary Justice</em> - Breq&rsquo;s been dispatched to another system, tasked with a mission but following her own motives.<br>
These books were also both fun, and I enjoyed reading them, but they ultimately lacked the multi-person ship&rsquo;s perspective that made the first book so special.</p>
