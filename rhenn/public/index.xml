      <description>Overall, I enjoyed this series, with some major caveats.
Miles is a very fun character to follow, and these books hold up well. The early books are (mostly) very fun, and I found most of them no challenge to get through.
My main problem was with the latter half of the series. As with most of Bujold&amp;rsquo;s books, there&amp;rsquo;s a tendency for characters to get happily traditionally married by the end of the series.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Haunting</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I&amp;rsquo;m biased towards Monette&amp;rsquo;s writing. I read Melusine a lot back in highschool, and it was a keystone in forming my tastes.
I enjoyed the mystery of this book. Kyle Murchison Booth is always fun to read, and Monette is very good at what she does. I only wish it was a little longer, as the ending felt quite abrupt.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed these books, and it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to see a NZ author. All the characters are interesting and each of the books have a central mystery that is both intriguing to find out and devastating at the conclusion.
Unfortunately, something about the writing stopped me from clicking with the characters.</description>

      <title>The Murderbot Diaries</title>

      <description>The Murderbot Diaries is a series of novels and novellas following Murderbot, a sentient bot who has hacked its governor chip.
I loved this series. Most of the novellas are relatively short, and easy reading. Despite that, each one manages a good amount of depth in terms of character, and Murderbot&amp;rsquo;s point of view is distinctive and fun to read.</description>

      <description>Overview [1869] is a relatively friendly esk, although they carry an air of loneliness wherever they go. Drowned at sea, they are constantly wandering along the edges of their boundary, looking for their owners from their past life. Finding nothing, they take comfort in swimming with the fauna that make their homes in the ruins.

      <title>Witch King</title>

      <description>Witch King follows the story of the demon Kai, who awakens after being killed, and his journey to find out what happened.
I wanted to enjoy Witch King more than I did. I loved Kai as a protagonist, and Wells&amp;rsquo; writing was enjoyable, but it suffered from the split timeline.
Witch King has two timelines - one set in the present, and one in the past. Both were very interesting, but I felt like not enough time was spent on either, leaving us with two half-stories.</description>

      <description>December 4, 2023 Put together image galleries for the Art section
December 3, 2023 Did a major overhaul of the site; most of this was on the backend and involved moving the site over to a Hugo template. The content of the site hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed too much (though galleries are gone temporarily) but loading times should be a lot faster now as there&amp;rsquo;s much less javascript.
July 31, 2023 Added &amp;ldquo;recent&amp;rdquo; gallery and homepage updates</description>
