      <description>The Eternal Sky trilogy follows the journey of Re Temur, as he seeks to reclaim his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s throne. Along with Temur, the series follows a number of other character perspectives.
As with the sequel series, Bear does a brilliant job of handling this; despite the large cast of characters most of them feel well fleshed out and interesting. These novels felt quite dense at times though - though I never struggled to get through them, they each took a long time to finish.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed these books, and it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to see a NZ author. All the characters are interesting and each of the books have a central mystery that is both intriguing to find out and devastating at the conclusion.
Unfortunately, something about the writing stopped me from clicking with the characters.</description>

      <title>Witch King</title>

      <description>Witch King follows the story of the demon Kai, who awakens after being killed, and his journey to find out what happened.
I wanted to enjoy Witch King more than I did. I loved Kai as a protagonist, and Wells&amp;rsquo; writing was enjoyable, but it suffered from the split timeline.
Witch King has two timelines - one set in the present, and one in the past. Both were very interesting, but I felt like not enough time was spent on either, leaving us with two half-stories.</description>
