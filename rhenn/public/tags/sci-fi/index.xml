      <description>Overall, I enjoyed this series, with some major caveats.
Miles is a very fun character to follow, and these books hold up well. The early books are (mostly) very fun, and I found most of them no challenge to get through.
My main problem was with the latter half of the series. As with most of Bujold&amp;rsquo;s books, there&amp;rsquo;s a tendency for characters to get happily traditionally married by the end of the series.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed these books, and it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to see a NZ author. All the characters are interesting and each of the books have a central mystery that is both intriguing to find out and devastating at the conclusion.
Unfortunately, something about the writing stopped me from clicking with the characters.</description>

      <title>The Murderbot Diaries</title>

      <description>The Murderbot Diaries is a series of novels and novellas following Murderbot, a sentient bot who has hacked its governor chip.
I loved this series. Most of the novellas are relatively short, and easy reading. Despite that, each one manages a good amount of depth in terms of character, and Murderbot&amp;rsquo;s point of view is distinctive and fun to read.</description>
