I recently took advantage of a sale at a local tea shop, and got a ton of loose-leaf tea samples. I thought it would be fun to jot down my notes and share them here.

### "Turkish Apple"

This one is just apples. What can I say, it's like drinking warm apple juice. A fairly mild flavour, which is a nice break from standard fruit teas which can be quite strong.

### Rooibos

Not sure how I feel about this one. It's not *bitter*, and it's not *bad*, but there's just something about the taste that I can't quite put my finger on. I probably should've steeped this one longer, because the taste isn't very strong.
