# February Updates, And some thoughts on getting better at art

Some stuff that I've been doing that I thought might be interesting to talk about. This is the first update!    
Site updates in general might be slow for a while since my uni's starting again soon - I'll do my best to update reviews, at the very least.

### Reading

I finished [System Collapse](#) earlier this month. I already have a review for the rest of [The Murderbot Diaries](/reviews/murderbot), so I'll be adding an update there. Currently I'm working on reading a few of the books on my shelf before I go hunting for more - starting with A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula K. LeGuin. I'm enjoying it so far :)

### Games

I'm not playing much consistently at the moment, but I'm trying to make the most of my free time while I still have it. My thesis looms...  

I *did* however manage to get a copy of Animal Crossing New Horizons, which has been fun to play in the evenings occasionally. I find with cozy games like ACNH that I can only play so much before getting bored, though. Maybe just not enough brain engagement for me - still, it's good for relaxing when I want to turn my brain off.  

I'm also slowly working on making a game of my own! It's a kind of typing game, which I'm mostly making as an excuse to learn touch typing and save my wrists a little. It's currently stalled though, as I'm struggling to think of a proper visual direction for it. I'm hoping to spend some proper time with it once I'm less bogged down with IRL stuff.

### Art

I haven't finished much this month in the way of digital art, but I have a couple of WIPs to share!

[put some images here]

The second is a prompt for the [World of Reos](https://www.deviantart.com/world-of-reos) group over on deviantart. Not sure if I'm going to finish the first one.

In other news, I've recently finished a sketchbook! This took 2 years, wow... on the other hand, I feel like I'm finally getting out of the burnout that's been plaguing my art since ~mid-2022. Hopefully it stays that way.  
I think a big contributor to that burnout was my own attitude towards art. Over time, I'd kind of lost the enjoyment of creating stuff; I'd put far too much focus on getting better, and doing things "properly". A lot of artists I followed at the time were either industry professionals or trying to break into the industry, and I got caught up in that. Add that to consistently worsening wrist pain, and eventually I was actively avoiding drawing. Fast forward a couple years, and it's been hard breaking myself back into the habit.  

I think I'm a lot more positive about art and creating again now, though. To anyone who may feel the same way, I'd recommend giving it time. It's okay to step away for a while, and you're only hurting yourself by beating yourself up about it. Additionally, if you're not planning to do art as a career, it's okay not to meet industry standards. Take time to study and improve when you want to, but make sure that you're also spending time just drawing for yourself. Try following [the 50% rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent). All and all, have fun!
